First repository for Gr.12 CS

My name is *Johnny*.

I'm a **Gr.12** student in **St. Robert CHS** and thinking of applying to either CS or engineering in universities such as *Waterloo, UofT, etc*.

As hobbies, I like to **produce electronic music** and also **play sports and video games**. I also love listening to all kinds of music to the point where I'd honestly say I wouldn't be able to stay sane if music didn't exist. 

Exposure to **sciences** and **technology** at an early age has influenced me to inquire about the processes behind things like the infrastructure of a city or the framework supporting a major application like Facebook or Instagram. I've also been really interested in how people develop video games, such as the Mario games, Minecraft, or even simple-concept mobile games (e.g. Flappy Bird) that can be found on the Google Play Store. As as result, I ended up taking the Gr.11 CS course last year and the Gr.12 CS course this year, in hopes of *understanding how such things can be programmed and built, starting from an absolutely blank canvas*.

That's basically about it for me, I'm not a very interesting person to be honest... hahaha
